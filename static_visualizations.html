                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This heatmap reveals interesting relationships between audio features in Spotify tracks. Key insights include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Weak to moderate correlations overall, suggesting these features are largely independent</li>
                    <li>Energy and acousticness show the strongest negative correlation (-0.40), indicating that more energetic tracks tend to be less acoustic</li>
                    <li>Danceability shows positive correlations with both valence (0.29) and speechiness (0.26), suggesting upbeat, vocal-heavy tracks tend to be more danceable</li>
                    <li>Instrumentalness shows very weak correlations with other features, indicating it's largely independent of other musical characteristics</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The seasonal distribution reveals clear patterns in music preferences across seasons:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Danceability (orange) maintains the highest average values consistently across all seasons, staying above 0.70</li>
                    <li>Energy levels (green) peak in Spring, contrary to the common assumption of Summer having the most energetic music</li>
                    <li>Valence (emotional positivity) shows moderate stability across seasons, with slight variations</li>
                    <li>Instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness maintain consistently lower values throughout the year</li>
                    <li>The annotation highlights "Peak Energy: Spring", marking the season with the most energetic music</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The monthly trends provide a more granular view of how music features evolve throughout the year:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Danceability (orange line) remains the most consistently high feature, hovering around 0.70-0.75 throughout the year</li>
                    <li>Valence (purple line) shows a gradual increase from winter to summer months, peaking around month 7 (July)</li>
                    <li>Acousticness (blue line) shows a slight upward trend towards the end of the year</li>
                    <li>Instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness (lower lines) maintain relatively stable, lower values throughout the year</li>
                    <li>Most dramatic changes occur in the middle of the year (months 6-8), suggesting summer months have the most dynamic variation in music characteristics</li>
